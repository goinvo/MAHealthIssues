# MAHealthIssues
Exploration and analysis of health issues in Massachusetts

## Goal

What does it mean to be a “big problem” in healthcare? What does it mean to be a “biggest problem” in health in the state of Massachusetts? Naively chasing data to construct a top ten list is fraught with problems. Issues are connected, messy, and don’t always lend themselves to being quantitatively measured. If the issue can be measured quantitatively, the measures of different issues don’t have the same units. It feels like comparing, not oranges to apples, but navel oranges to empire apples. In this project we try to make some sense of this. Learn what we can about the big problems facing MA in health care, and how those problems are related to each other and to even larger challenges facing MA and America. This sounds ambitious, so the first task is to carve out a question we can ask or a portion we can tackle.
